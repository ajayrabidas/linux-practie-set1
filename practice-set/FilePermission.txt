#########       Topic: File Permissions               #########

What are the different types of file permissions in Linux?
Explain the read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions and their significance for files and directories.
"Read (r): Allows viewing the contents of a file or listing a directory's contents.
Write (w): Permits modifying a file's contents or adding/removing files in a directory.
Execute (x): Enables running a file as a program or accessing a directory's contents"

How are permissions assigned to user, group, and others?
Discuss the rwxr-xr-- format and the roles of user (owner), group, and others.
"Permissions are divided among:
User (u): The file's owner.
Group (g): Users belonging to the file's group.
Others (o): All other users.
For example, -rwxr-xr-- means:
User: Read, write, execute.
Group: Read, execute.
Others: Read only."

What is the numeric (octal) representation of permissions?
Describe how permissions translate to numbers, e.g., chmod 755 equates to rwxr-xr-x.
"Permissions can be represented numerically:
Read (r): 4
Write (w): 2
Execute (x): 1

Summing these gives:
rwx = 4+2+1 = 7
rw- = 4+2+0 = 6
r-- = 4+0+0 = 4

So, chmod 755 file sets:
User: 7 (rwx)
Group: 5 (r-x)
Others: 5 (r-x)"

How do you change file permissions using chmod?
Provide examples using both symbolic (chmod u+x file) and numeric (chmod 755 file) modes.
"Symbolic mode: chmod u+x file adds execute permission for the user.
Numeric mode: chmod 755 file sets permissions as described above."

How do you change file ownership using chown and chgrp?
Explain how to change the owner and group of a file.
"Change owner: chown user file
Change group: chgrp group file
Change both: chown user:group file"

A user cannot write to a file they own. What could be the issue?
Discuss potential causes like directory permissions or file attributes.
"Possible reasons:
File is read-only: Check with ls -l.
Directory lacks write permission: User needs write permission on the directory.
File has immutable attribute: Check with lsattr; remove with chattr -i file."

How do you set default permissions for new files?
Explain the role of umask in setting default permissions.
"Use umask to define default permissions.
Default file permissions: 666
Default directory permissions: 777
umask subtracts permissions.

For example, umask 022 results in:
Files: 644 (rw-r--r--)
Directories: 755 (rwxr-xr-x)"

What is the difference between symbolic and numeric modes in chmod?
Compare chmod u+x file vs. chmod 755 file.
"Symbolic: Uses letters to represent permissions, e.g., chmod u+x file.
Numeric: Uses numbers, e.g., chmod 755 file."

How do you recursively change permissions for all files in a directory?
Demonstrate using chmod -R for recursive permission changes.
chmod -R 755 /path/to/directory

A user cannot delete a file in a directory they have write access to. Why?
Discuss directory permissions and the sticky bit's role.
"Deleting a file requires write and execute permissions on the directory, not just the file.
Also, if the directory has the sticky bit set (common in /tmp), only the file owner or root can delete files."

What is the setuid permission, and how does it work?
Explain how setuid allows users to execute a file with the file owner's privileges.

A script with rwxr-xr-x permissions doesn't execute. What could be wrong?
"Potential issues:
Incorrect shebang: Ensure the first line specifies the correct interpreter, e.g., #!/bin/bash.
Missing execute permission on interpreter: Check if /bin/bash is executable.
Script has Windows line endings: Convert using dos2unix script.sh."

A user cannot access a file despite having the correct permissions. What steps would you take to troubleshoot?
"Check parent directory permissions: User needs execute permission on all parent directories.
Verify ACLs: Use getfacl to check for restrictive ACLs.
Inspect SELinux/AppArmor: Security modules might block access."
